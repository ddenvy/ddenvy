### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Danny
#### I am Junior Unity developer
I am a beginner unit developer. I started learning C# and Unity development on my own with the help of a mentor. I tried to learn C++, Python, but most of all I was hooked by game development! I also tried myself as a sound designer, as I have a lot of experience in the music industry. In November 2022, I decided to change my profession to a developer and I improve my skills every day


âš¡ My goal is to learn a new profession and find a job.
